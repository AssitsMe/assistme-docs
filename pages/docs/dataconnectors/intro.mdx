# Data Connectors


Data connectors, also known as Readers, are key parts of AssistMe that help bring in data from different sources and formats. They simplify this data into a Document form, which includes text and some basic information. This makes it easier for you to work with a variety of data in AssistMe.

As you embark on your linguistic journey, keep in mind the token limit ratio, which determines the maximum length of your input. This ratio ensures that your interactions with the model remain dynamic and efficient. Experiment with different prompts to guide AssistMe's responses â€“ a carefully crafted prompt can lead to more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

Adjust the temperature to fine-tune the creativity of AssistMe's responses. A higher temperature introduces more randomness, resulting in diverse and imaginative answers, while a lower temperature produces more focused and deterministic outputs. Strike the perfect balance to suit your specific needs and preferences.

# Users

The Users view provides an overview of all users. It also offers an in-depth look into individual users.

It's easy to map data in Varex to individual users. Just pass a unique identifier as the `userId` when you create a `trace`. This can be a username, email, or any other unique identifier. The `userId` is optional, but using it helps you get more from Varex. See the integration docs to learn more.

## View all users

The user list provides an overview of all users that have been tracked by Varex. It makes it simple to segment by overall token usage, number of traces, and user feedback.

## Individual user view

The individual user view provides an in-depth look into a single user. Explore aggregated metrics or view all traces and feedback for a user.

# Export & Fine-tuning

You can export data via the public API or export it in the Varex UI.

You can use the exported data to train or fine-tune models on the production traces in Varex.

## Public API

All data in Varex is available via the GET API. Refer to the [API docs](/docs/api) for more information.

Example routes

- `GET/v1/public/traces`
- `GET/v1/public/traces/:traceId`
- `GET/v1/public/observations`
- `GET/v1/public/observations/:observationId`

## Export via UI [Beta]

The generations table in Varex allows you to export generations. All filters applied to the table will be applied to the export.

Available export formats:

- CSV
- JSON
- JSONL (OpenAI format for fine-tuning)

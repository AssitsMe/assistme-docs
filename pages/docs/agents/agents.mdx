An Agent is a configured instance of an artificial intelligence capable of searching for documents, executing tasks using external tools, and interacting with users via text or voice. Following the search phase, responses are generated by large language models such as ChatGPT, Mistral, or LLaMA. Some of these AI agents, specifically designed to assist individuals with their daily tasks, are referred to as 'Co-pilots'.

As you embark on your linguistic journey, keep in mind the token limit ratio, which determines the maximum length of your input. This ratio ensures that your interactions with the model remain dynamic and efficient. Experiment with different prompts to guide AssistMe's responses – a carefully crafted prompt can lead to more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

Adjust the temperature to fine-tune the creativity of AssistMe's responses. A higher temperature introduces more randomness, resulting in diverse and imaginative answers, while a lower temperature produces more focused and deterministic outputs. Strike the perfect balance to suit your specific needs and preferences.

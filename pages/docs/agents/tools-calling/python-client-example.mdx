## Python Client Example for Enabling API Calling
To enable API calling in your Agent using the AssistMe Python client, you can use the `client.agent.enable_api_calling` method. This method allows you to activate the API calling feature for a specific agent and define functions for various tasks such as getting a customer's balance, age, or last failed transactions.
Below is an updated example demonstrating how to use this method with the necessary parameters:
```python
pythonCopy codefrom assistme import AssistMe
client = AssistMe()
# Specify the unique agent identifier
agent_id = "your_agent_id_here"
# Define the function for getting a customer's balance
get_customer_balance_function = {
   "type": "function",
   "function": {
       "name": "get_customer_balance",
       "description": "Retrieves the current balance for a specified customer",
       "endpoint": {
           "url": "https://api.example.com/customer/balance",
           "method": "GET",
           "headers": {
               "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
           }
       },
       "parameters": {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
               "customerId": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "description": "The unique identifier for the customer"
               }
           },
           "required": ["customerId"]
       }
   }
}
# Enable API calling for the agent with the defined function
response = client.agent.enable_api_calling(agent_id=agent_id, function=get_customer_balance_function)
# Print the response to verify the configuration has been applied
print(response)
```
In this example, replace `your_agent_id_here` with the actual ID of your agent and `"Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"` with the real bearer token required for authorization against the API you are calling. Adjust the function definition (`get_customer_balance_function`) as needed for other API calls, such as getting a customer's age or information on the last failed transactions.
This method configures your agent to make external API calls, extending its functionality beyond basic conversational capabilities to interact with external data sources and services dynamically.

## Enable Hallucination Guard:

In the pursuit of accuracy and reliability, Agent Config introduces the "Enable Hallucination Guard" option. Activate this feature to enhance the robustness of your interactions.

## Use Cache:

Efficiency meets customization with the "Use Cache" option. Enable this setting to store and retrieve previously processed information, reducing response times and optimizing your workflow. With caching in place, your interactions become faster and more responsive. This option is particularly valuable when dealing with recurrent queries or tasks, as it minimizes redundant computations and enhances the overall efficiency of your Agent Config.

## Cache Threshold:

Fine-tune your caching experience with the "Cache Threshold" option. This parameter allows you to set the level of sensitivity for caching decisions. Adjust the threshold to strike the perfect balance between preserving system resources and maximizing the benefits of caching. A higher threshold may lead to more aggressive caching, while a lower one might prioritize computational freshness. Tailor the Cache Threshold to suit your specific needs and preferences, ensuring a seamless and optimized interaction with Agent Config.

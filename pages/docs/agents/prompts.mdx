# Prompt Management

Use Varex to effectively manage and version your prompts. This allows you to iterate quickly, publish new prompt versions without redeploying your app, and track metrics by version.

## How to use Varex for prompt management

Varex features an integrated mechanism that enables version control and oversees the development process and release of new prompt versions.

### Create / Update prompts

**Create**

</Frame>


**Update**

Use the edit button in the Varex UI or create a new prompt version via the SDKs with the same name.

### Promote prompt to production

Set a prompt version to `active` when creating. In the Varex UI, you can promote a prompt version to production:

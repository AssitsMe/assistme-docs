# Prompt Management

Use AssistMe to effectively manage and version your prompts. This allows you to iterate quickly, publish new prompt versions without redeploying your app, and track metrics by version.

## How to use AssistMe for prompt management

The workflow for managing prompts in AssistMe includes the following steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["1. Create new prompt version (SDK or UI)"] --> PV
    subgraph S1["Prompt (identified by name)"]
        PV["Prompt Version"] -->|"2. Promote"| PP["Production Prompt"]
    end
```

### Create / Update prompts

**Create**


<Frame border fullWidth>
  ![Create prompt](/images/docs/prompt_managment.gif)
</Frame>


**Update**

Use the edit button in the AssistMe UI or create a new prompt version via the SDKs with the same name.

### Promote prompt to production

Set a prompt version to `active` when creating. In the AssistMe UI, you can promote a prompt version to production:

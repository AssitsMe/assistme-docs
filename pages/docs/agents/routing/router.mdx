**Router - Load Balancing and Fallback Mechanisms**

Router in the Varex platform is designed to enhance the efficiency and reliability of handling requests across various deployments, such as Azure and OpenAI. Its capabilities include:

- **Load Balancing**: Efficiently distributing incoming requests across multiple deployments to ensure optimal utilization of resources.
- **Priority Queuing**: Implementing a queuing mechanism to prioritize critical requests, minimizing the risk of important operations failing.
- **Advanced Reliability Features**: Incorporating a set of reliability mechanisms, including cooldown periods, fallback strategies, timeout settings, and retry policies (both fixed and exponential backoff), across different deployments and providers.

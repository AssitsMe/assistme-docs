## Load Balancing Configuration Guide

This guide demonstrates how to configure load balancing for the Varex router using the Varex Python client. This configuration ensures efficient distribution of requests across multiple instances of a specific model to optimize throughput and reliability.

### Configuration Details

To configure load balancing, specify each model instance's details, including the model name, deployment identifier, API base URL, API key, and the rate limit measured in requests per minute (RPM).

#### Example Configuration

```python
from assistme import AssistMe

client = AssistMe()

# Define the load balancing configuration with detailed explanations for each parameter
router_config = {
    "model_list": [
        {
            "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",  # The name of the model for load balancing
            "model": "azure/gpt-turbo-small-eu",  # Model instance identifier
            "api_base": "https://my-endpoint-europe-berri-992.openai.azure.com/",  # API base URL
            "api_key": "[Your_API_Key_Here]",  # API key for authentication
            "rpm": 6  # RPM (Requests Per Minute): Rate limit for this deployment
        },
        {
            "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            "model": "azure/gpt-turbo-small-ca",
            "api_base": "https://my-endpoint-canada-berri992.openai.azure.com/",
            "api_key": "[Your_API_Key_Here]",
            "rpm": 6  # RPM (Requests Per Minute): Rate limit for this deployment
        },
        {
            "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            "model": "azure/gpt-turbo-large",
            "api_base": "https://openai-france-1234.openai.azure.com/",
            "api_key": "[Your_API_Key_Here]",
            "rpm": 1440  # RPM (Requests Per Minute): Rate limit for this deployment
        }
    ]
}

# Apply the configuration using the router.configure method
response = client.router.configure(router_config=router_config)

# Print the response to verify the configuration has been applied
print(response)
```

#### Key Parameters Explained:

- **`model_name`**: Identifies the model version for which load balancing is configured.
- **`model`**: Specifies the model instance, facilitating request routing to the appropriate deployment.
- **`api_base`**: The base URL for the API endpoint of the model instance, necessary for directing requests.
- **`api_key`**: A unique key required for authenticating requests to the model's API endpoint.
- **`rpm`**: Stands for "Requests Per Minute," indicating the rate limit for requests to the specified model instance. This parameter helps manage throughput and ensures balanced distribution across deployments.

Replace `[Your_API_Key_Here]` with your actual API keys for each deployment. The `router.configure` method is a placeholder for the actual method used to configure the router in the Varex client; refer to the Varex client library documentation for exact usage.

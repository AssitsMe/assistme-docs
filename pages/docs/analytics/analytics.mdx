## Metrics

- **Quality** is measured through user feedback, model-based scoring, human-in-the-loop scored samples or custom scores via SDKs/API (see [scores](/docs/scores)). Quality is assessed over time as well as across prompt versions, LLMs and users.
- **Cost and Latency** are accurately measured and broken down by user, session, geography, feature, model and prompt version.
- **Volume** based on the ingested traces and tokens used.

## Dimensions

Analytics is incrementally adoptable based on the data you send to AssistMe. The following dimensions are available:

- Trace name: differentiate between different use cases, features, etc. by adding a `name` field to your traces.
- User: track usage and cost by user, see [user-level analytics](/docs/user-explorer) for more details.
- Release and version numbers: track how changes to the LLM application affected your metrics.

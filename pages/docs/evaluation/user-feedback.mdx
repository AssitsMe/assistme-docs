# User Feedback

User feedback is a great source to evaluate the quality of an LLM app's output. In Varex, feedback is collected as a [`score`](/docs/llmops/scores) and attached to an execution trace or an individual LLM generation.

## Types of Feedback

Depending on the type of the application, there are different types of feedback that can be collected that vary in quality, detail, and quantity.

- **Explicit Feedback**: Directly prompt the user to give feedback, this can be a rating, a like, a dislike, a scale or a comment. While it is simple to implement, quality and quantity of the feedback is often low.
- **Implicit Feedback**: Measure the user's behavior, e.g., time spent on a page, click-through rate, accepting/rejecting a model-generated output. This type of feedback is more difficult to implement but is often more frequent and reliable.
